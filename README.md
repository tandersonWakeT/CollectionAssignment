Collections Assignment for HCL Training:

	Store instances of EmployeeDetails in an ArrayList, loop through the list and
		print the EmpNo, EmpName, and Location parameters for each instance of EmployeeDetails.
  
	
	Describe when each Collection should be used:
  
      1. ArrayList: It is best to use an ArrayList if you are Searching the list frequently,
      				but also not adding/removing elements often.
      
      2. Map: Map should be used when data is stored as Key:Value pairs.
      		-Tree Map if the data needs to be stored in sorted order
      		-Hash Map if the data Value needs to be retrieved by the data Key frequently and quickly
      
      3. Set: Set should be used when data values must be unique.
